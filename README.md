## General Information
'Naughts and crosses' or also known as 'tic tac toe' is a simple game with two players. The board consists of a three by three grid and each player is represented by one distinct symbol, a cross or a naught. Players alternate placing their symbols on the grid, and win until 3 of their symbols are placed in a row, column or diagonal (shown with a line through the winning combo). If all the grid positions are filled without a win, the game ends in a draw.


### What problems does it solve?
'Naughts and Crosses' was first played using a pencil and paper. To play another round of this game, one must clear the grid of all symbols or redraw a new grid. With this website, players' are able to restart the game instantaneously, place symbols with one click instead of manually inscribing the symbol, and record wins effortlessly and automatically.

### What is the purpose of this project?
